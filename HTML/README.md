### Summary of Key Points

1. **Definition of the Internet**:
   - The Internet is essentially a long piece of wire connecting computers globally.
   - Itâ€™s not a cloud or complex entity but a simple physical network.

2. **Servers and Clients**:
   - **Servers**: Special computers online 24/7, serving data and files for websites.
   - **Clients**: Computers used by users to access the Internet.

3. **Analogy**:
   - A web server is like a giant 24/7 library serving website data upon request.

4. **Request Process**:
   - When you type a URL (e.g., google.com), your browser sends a message to your ISP (e.g., AT&T, Comcast).
   - The ISP relays the message to a DNS server, which acts like a phone book to find the IP address of the website.
   - The DNS server returns the IP address to your browser via the ISP, allowing a direct request to the server hosting the website.

5. **IP Addresses**:
   - Every computer on the Internet has a unique IP address, similar to a postal code, for sending and receiving data.

6. **Undersea Cables**:
   - Massive undersea cables connect continents, consisting of hundreds of fiber optic fibers.
   - These cables use lasers to transmit up to 400 gigabytes of data per second.

7. **Technology Marvel**:
   - The Internet involves complex, high-speed data transmission through these cables, enabling rapid access to websites globally.

8. **Practical Exploration**:
   - Tools like nslookup.io can be used to find the IP address of websites.
   - Submarinecablemap.com shows the global network of undersea cables.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - Understanding the Internet's infrastructure is crucial for building websites and web apps.

### Summary of Key Points

1. **Introduction**:
   - The Internet connects client computers with server computers.
   - DNS servers act as a phonebook to look up IP addresses of websites.

2. **Types of Files in Web Development**:
   - **HTML**: Contains the content of the website (text, images, buttons, links). It's the structure or "bricks" of a website.
   - **CSS**: Responsible for styling the website (colors, fonts, layout). It defines the appearance of the HTML content.
   - **JavaScript**: Adds functionality to the website (interactive elements, dynamic content). It makes the website interactive and functional.

3. **Browser Role**:
   - The browser loads HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to render web pages.
   - HTML provides content, CSS provides styling, and JavaScript provides functionality.

4. **Example: Google Homepage**:
   - HTML: Displays the Google logo, buttons, and text box.
   - CSS: Styles the appearance of these elements.
   - JavaScript: Enables the search functionality.

5. **Practical Exercise with Chrome Developer Tools**:
   - Inspect and modify website elements using Chrome Developer Tools.
   - Example: Changing the "Google Search" button text to "Angela Search."
   - Changes are temporary and revert on page refresh.

6. **Importance of Tools**:
   - Chrome Developer Tools are recommended for web development.
   - Use these tools to inspect and modify HTML and CSS in real-time.

7. **Learning Outcome**:
   - Future lessons will cover creating and hosting your own websites.
   - Emphasis on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build functional, styled, and interactive websites.

8. **Fun and Practical Application**:
   - Use developer tools to prank friends by temporarily changing website content.
   - Understand that these changes are local and not permanent.

9. **Course Continuation**:
   - Upcoming lessons will delve deeper into web development tools and techniques.

### Summary of Key Points

1. **Introduction to HTML**:
   - Browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Brave render websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Websites can't be created with just CSS or JavaScript, but an HTML file alone can create a simple website.

2. **HTML Basics**:
   - **HTML**: Stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
   - Defines the content and structure of a website.

3. **Hypertext**:
   - Hypertext refers to text with links (hyperlinks) to other documents.
   - The first websites, such as the one by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, were built with HTML and filled with hyperlinks.

4. **Markup Language**:
   - Markup languages use tags to define elements within the text, similar to how English uses quotation marks or editing symbols.

5. **HTML Tags**:
   - Tags are the building blocks of HTML.
   - Examples of important tags: 
     - **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>`
     - **Paragraph**: `<p>`

6. **Historical Context**:
   - Early HTML had few tags, but more have been added over time.
   - Despite many tags existing, only a few essential ones are commonly used.

7. **Learning Approach**:
   - Focus on essential HTML tags necessary for projects and exercises.
   - Start with learning the heading tag (`<h1>`), one of the first and most fundamental HTML tags.

8. **Next Steps**:
   - Future lessons will cover the usage and functionality of key HTML tags.
